# Thermodynamics-of-Hurricanes

In this project, I used Matlab to study the energy stored in Hurricanes using various real input conditions. I made use of the climatic toolbox that stores real-time temperature and pressure values across the globe.

Using this data we can have a rough estimate in terms of the power of the Hurricane
